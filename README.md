# Simple_Server
I'm writing this server for two reasons:
1. To learn some node before moving on to packages/frameworks.
2. To create a light server to use for local testing/development.

So far this server has been useful. It didn't take very long to throw together, and I will be adding additional file types as I go.
Any help would be greatly appreciated, although I don't expect anyone to even find this repo, lol!
